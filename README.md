# wordpress_site_automation
It is basically a Wordpress bot which scraps the news data from various site like Hindustan Times, NDTV etc and paraphrase it using paraphrase API which was hosted on digital ocean. Then it will open Wordpress admin step by step and perform on its own. We can directly go and watch the site in which the news or blogs will be updated. It has been some time since I created this project so maybe xpaths have been changed. 

Moreover, it contains different libs and tools that are used for the quality purpose and apart from that it contains ML and NLP based tool for paragraph paraphrasing.

It also contains some files which are used in wordpress automation such as File uploading, Blog writing, Basic SEO (Rank Math SEO plugin), Post management (Including Deleting post uploading post and status changing).
